          <p class="lead">The City of Vancouver works 24 hours every day of the year to support a safe and welcoming, vibrant and prosperous community.</p>
          <p class="lead">City Council sets the vision for the community and adopts policies and a budget in support of that vision. The City Manager leads and manages City staff and departments in the delivery of a wide range of customer and resident-focused services—from fire and police services to summer playground programs—that support the safety and livability of this great city.</p>
          <p class="lead">While it’s not practical to report every single accomplishment from 2020, the following represents a sample from this extraordinary year.</p>

          <p class="lead">The City responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis in numerous ways:</p>
          <ul class="lead">
          <li>Declared a state of emergency on March 13, 2020, and issued emergency orders that expanded financial assistance to City utility customers struggling to pay their water/sewer bills, defended against residential foreclosures on private mortgages, protected small businesses from eviction, suspended on-street parking fees, required landlords wear personal protective equipment when entering rental units, and cancelled City-permitted events.</li>
          <li>Opened a Safe Parking Zone in coordination with Vancouver Mall and C-TRAN, providing a safe location for homeless residents sheltering in their vehicles during the pandemic. The site provides portable restroom facilities, handwashing stations, garbage service, and access to other services.</li>
          <li>Created the Street Eats Program, which through special permitting helped restaurants add outdoor seating. The program also provided an online tool for customers to find businesses with outdoor seating or curbside pickup.
          <li>Operated distance learning camps at the Firstenburg and Marshall community centers to support remote learning for elementary school-age children.</li>
          <li>Partnered with Clark County to distribute more than $1 million in grants to small local businesses—with a focus on women- and minority-owned businesses.</li> 
          <li>Partnered with Mercy Corps Northwest to distribute $10,000 of personal protective equipment to more than 30 small businesses.</li> 
          <li>Waived business license surcharges to assist businesses heavily impacted by the economic recession –providing $5.5 million in direct relief to businesses.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>       
        <div class="col-lg-6 showcase-text">
          <p class="lead">The City initiated a variety of social justice actions:</p>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li>City Council issued a statement acknowledging the existence of systemic racism and societal inequalities within our country and community and committed to taking action to try and correct it.</li>
            <li>City Council hosted several online community listening sessions on systemic racism in Vancouver.</li>
            <li>Invited residents to share their stories and ideas about racial justice on <a href="https://www.beheardvancouver.org/">BeHeardVancouver.org</a>.</li>
            <li>Created a Community Task Force on Policing that will assist with the implementation of 84 recommendations included in a recent use-of-force study commissioned by the Vancouver Police Department and advise the City on establishing a police camera program to install body-worn and vehicle dash and in-car cameras.</li> 
            <li>The Vancouver Police Department secured grants to fund and leverage support for key initiatives, including a new partnership that added full-time mental health professionals to assist officers with de-escalating crisis calls in the field.</li>
            <li>City Attorney’s Office made equity-based changes to the way it prosecutes the crime of driving while license suspended in the third degree and provided a way for people diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder to have misdemeanor charges dismissed if they successfully complete a year-long treatment program.</li>
            <li>City Council formed a citizen task force that developed a variety of options the City can consider to foster greater diversity on City Council. The task force considered changes to both how City Councilmembers are elected and opportunities for increasing community engagement and participation in City government.</li>
